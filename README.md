# E-Voting System

## Introduction
This repository contains the code and documentation for an E-Voting System, a project that I have developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP for the backend, and a MySQL database.

## Features
- User registration and authentication for secure voting.
- Ballot creation and management.
- Real-time vote counting and result display(but in this i have created statically).
- Secure database storage for voter and ballot information.
- Responsive web design for accessibility on various devices.

## Technologies Used
- HTML: For creating the project's front-end structure.
- CSS: For styling the user interface.
- JavaScript: For adding interactivity to the web application.
- PHP: For the backend logic and user authentication.
- MySQL: To store and manage user and voting data.

## User Registration
For user registration and authentication, PHP backend is used to ensure a secure and reliable process. JavaScript is not used for this purpose to enhance security.
